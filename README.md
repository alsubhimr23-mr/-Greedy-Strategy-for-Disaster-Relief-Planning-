I managing a disaster relief operation in a region affected by flooding. Various types of 
relief supplies (food packs, water bottles, medical kits, blankets, hygiene kits) are available from 
different donors. Each supply type has a limited quantity and an impact value per unit, 
representing its effectiveness in helping the affected population. The relief warehouse has a 
maximum storage capacity, so you must select supplies in a way that maximizes total impact while 
staying within the storage limit. I use python to acheive this goal.
By choosing Potential Greedy Solutions: 
  a. Optimal Greedy solution 
  b. Non-Optimal Greedy Solution

As well as I scheduling volunteers to cover shifts at relief centers. Each 
shift has a number of volunteers required, a coverage value (effectiveness in helping victims), and 
a cost in hours per volunteer. Your goal is to maximize relief coverage while keeping the total 
volunteer hours within your available budget. A shift must be fully staffed if selected; otherwise, 
it is skipped.
