I managing a disaster relief operation in a region affected by flooding. Various types of 
relief supplies (food packs, water bottles, medical kits, blankets, hygiene kits) are available from 
different donors. Each supply type has a limited quantity and an impact value per unit, 
representing its effectiveness in helping the affected population. The relief warehouse has a 
maximum storage capacity, so you must select supplies in a way that maximizes total impact while 
staying within the storage limit. I use python to acheive this goal.
